# retro-2015
A new (circa 2015) implementation of the Lisp for the Web voting app

The original implementation is in Adam Tornhill's article (and book) [Lisp for the Web](http://www.adamtornhill.com/articles/lispweb.htm). At least one [updated](http://msnyder.info/posts/2011/07/lisp-for-the-web-part-ii/) version is out there, written by Matthew Snyder.

This version is a re-write, with the intention of using the latest libraries and practices in Common Lisp as described in the article [State of the Common Lisp Ecosystem, 2015](http://eudoxia.me/article/common-lisp-sotu-2015/)
